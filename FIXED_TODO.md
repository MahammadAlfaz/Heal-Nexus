# MedicineScanService Fixes - TODO List

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Fixed Image Storage Path
- **Issue**: Relative path `uploads/medicine_images` was not working correctly in Spring Boot
- **Fix**: Changed to absolute path using `System.getProperty("user.dir")` + imageStoragePath
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. Added Tesseract Tessdata Configuration
- **Issue**: Tesseract requires language data files (tessdata) to function
- **Fix**: 
  - Created `tessdata` directory in project root
  - Downloaded `eng.traineddata` file from official Tesseract repository
  - Copied to `backend/tessdata` for correct path resolution
  - Set datapath in code: `tesseract.setDatapath(System.getProperty("user.dir") + "\\backend\\tessdata")`
  - Set language to English: `tesseract.setLanguage("eng")`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Improved AI Prompt for Better JSON Response
- **Issue**: Basic prompt was not returning proper structured JSON
- **Fix**: Enhanced prompt to specify exact JSON structure with required fields:
  - brandName, generic, category, uses (array), dosage, foodInstructions
  - sideEffects (object with common and serious arrays), warnings (array), isCritical (boolean)
  - Added instructions to return ONLY valid JSON
  - Added fallback handling for missing information
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 4. Added Error Handling and Fallback
- **Issue**: Blocking call `structuredDataMono.block()` could cause timeouts
- **Fix**: Added try-catch block around AI processing
  - If AI fails, saves extracted text with error message
  - Prevents service crashes due to AI failures
  - Added JSON cleaning to remove markdown formatting
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 5. Fixed Frontend API Connection
- **Issue**: Frontend proxy not working, causing ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- **Fix**: Changed `API_BASE_URL` from '/api' to 'http://localhost:8081/api' for direct backend calls
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 6. Removed Unused Imports
- **Issue**: Unused import `java.io.File` was present
- **Fix**: Removed unused import to clean up code
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Summary of Changes Made

The MedicineScanService has been significantly improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Robust Image Storage**: Uses absolute paths for reliable file storage
2. **Proper OCR Setup**: Tesseract is now properly configured with language data
3. **Better AI Integration**: Enhanced prompts for structured JSON responses
4. **Error Resilience**: Added fallback mechanisms for AI failures
5. **Frontend Connectivity**: Fixed API connection issues
6. **Code Quality**: Removed unused imports and improved error handling

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Test API Connectivity**: Verify frontend can connect to backend APIs
2. **Test OCR Functionality**: Upload a medicine image and verify text extraction
3. **Test AI Processing**: Check that structured data is properly parsed from OCR text
4. **Test Error Handling**: Verify graceful handling when AI service is unavailable
5. **Test File Storage**: Confirm images are saved to the correct directory

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing async processing for better performance
- Add image preprocessing (resize, enhance contrast) for better OCR accuracy
- Implement caching for frequently scanned medicines
- Add support for multiple languages in OCR
- Consider adding image validation (file type, size limits)

---

**All critical issues have been resolved. The MedicineScanService should now work properly with OCR and AI processing.**
